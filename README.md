## Development

- This step only applies if you've opted out of having the CLI install dependencies for you:

  ```sh
  npx remix init
  ```

- Initial setup: _If you just generated this project, this step has been done for you._

  ```sh
  npm run setup
  ```

- Start dev server:

  ```sh
  npm run dev
  ```
  
- Run cypress tests in development

  ```sh
  npm run test:e2e:dev
  ```

This starts your app in development mode, rebuilding assets on file changes.

The database seed script creates a new user with some data you can use to get started:
